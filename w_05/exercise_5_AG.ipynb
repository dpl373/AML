    "\n",
    "In this task, we go through the excellent blog post [The Building Blocks of Interpretability](https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/) by Chris Olah to understand what a network has learned about an image. In particular, we look **conceptually** into the features that the network learned for representing the aspects of images and how filtered parts of the input are attributed to an output class. We look into one implementation for these two steps in task 05.3.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Inspect the *spatial attribution (with saliency maps)* on the different layers. Focus on how the activation of the learned features or \"visual dictionary\" emerged. Simple question first: why are the attribution spaces different? What attribution did you find between the different layers (w.r.t. your input image)? How are the spatial positions different, which the different layers look at?\n",
    "\t- the attribution spaces are different, as they \"indicate how strongly the network detected features at that position\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the final step, the blog post explores how factorising all the feature channels can provide meaningful insight into the decision process of the network. Have the identified neuron groups learned and localised features that are similar to what your brain would spot as important to detect the animals or objects in the image? Now think about data that the network was trained with (we'll read into ImageNet in task 05.4): Can you find features that the network is focussing on that are counter-intuitive and potentially too specific to the image or dataset?\n",

    "For this task, we look into an **implementation** of using gradient information to visualise how the network has learned to represent features and to attribute them for an image w.r.t. an output class. The key aim is to look more closely into visualising patterns (features!) that some neurons represent and into the importance, or salience, of specific input patches for the output, this time with a prepared implementation via *w05_visualisation_saliencymaps_pytorch.ipynb* (or in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DwfbC37TpLCWrqHrVcPt86zjabmca4zP)).\n",

    "- Explore and visualise what patterns maximise the output for **other** classes that you find interesting (first for the church images, then for your own from the previous sub-task. The *imagenet_classes* dictionary can tell you the id for other classes. Did the network identify salient patterns in the images that, in fact, do resemble aspects of your chosen class?\n",

    "  *Hint:* We no longer need to constrain the noise to be spatially smooth, but we want it to be small in general so that the perturbation to the original images is not perceivable by a human. The input to the network should be the perturbed image, not the perturbation itself.\n",
